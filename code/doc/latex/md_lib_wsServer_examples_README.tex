This directory contains usage examples and demos for many different scenarios that might happen when using ws\+Server.

{\bfseries{The examples\+:}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}echo\mbox{]}(echo)\+: A simple echo server that broadcasts incoming messages to all connected clients.
\item \mbox{[}vtouchpad\mbox{]}(vtouchpad)\+: A \textquotesingle{}virtual touchpad\textquotesingle{} that remotely controls a computer\textquotesingle{}s mouse.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you have other examples and/or small demos that might be useful for illustrating ws\+Server\textquotesingle{}s functionality, feel free to submit a PR.\hypertarget{md_lib_wsServer_examples_README_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{md_lib_wsServer_examples_README_autotoc_md37}
A typical build with {\ttfamily make} or {\ttfamily cmake} should be able to compile all examples by default. However, note that some examples/demos may be platform specific (either Linux, Windows...), so check the specific README for each example in their respective folders for more information.
