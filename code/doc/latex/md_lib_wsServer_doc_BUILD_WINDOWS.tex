Unlike Linux, Windows does not have by default a package manager or native build tools, which makes the process a little more laborious, but the sections below clarify in detail what must be done to natively build the library.\hypertarget{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{MSYS2 Setup}\label{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md7}
MSYS2 is a set of tools and libraries that provide an easy-\/to-\/use development environment and is, in my opinion, the most straightforward way to use C in Windows environments.

The \href{https://www.msys2.org/}{\texttt{ home page}} already illustrates the basic step-\/by-\/step for the initial setup of MSYS2 but below is a very brief description of what to do\+:

(note\+: if you already have Min\+GW and CMake properly installed, you can skip this section entirely)\hypertarget{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{1) Download and install MSYS2}\label{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md8}
From the homepage (informed above) download the latest version available, or if you prefer, use the same version tested here\+: \href{https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2021-06-04/msys2-x86_64-20210604.exe}{\texttt{ msys2-\/x86\+\_\+64-\/20210604.\+exe}}.\hypertarget{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{2) Update packages}\label{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md9}
MSYS2 uses Pacman, a package manager, that is, a program responsible for managing programs, libraries, and their dependencies installed on a machine. Very well known among Arch Linux users, it is very useful to have it on MSYS2.

1) First, it is necessary to update the package database and base packages. If it hasn\textquotesingle{}t already opened, run \textquotesingle{}MSYS2 MSYS\textquotesingle{} from the Start menu and run {\ttfamily pacman -\/Syu}.

2) To proceed with the update, the terminal needs to be closed and opened again. After that, continue the update with\+: {\ttfamily pacman -\/Su}.\hypertarget{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{3) Install packages}\label{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md10}
In addition to the base packages, some packages need to be installed to have a minimal development environment\+:

1) Basic packages and GCC toolchain\+: {\ttfamily pacman -\/S -\/-\/needed base-\/devel mingw-\/w64-\/x86\+\_\+64-\/toolchain}. 2) CMake and Git\+: {\ttfamily pacman -\/S mingw-\/w64-\/x86\+\_\+64-\/cmake git}.\hypertarget{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{ws\+Server build}\label{md_lib_wsServer_doc_BUILD_WINDOWS_autotoc_md11}
With MSYS2 up and running, you have everything you need to download, compile and run the ws\+Server and its examples.

To do this, run \textquotesingle{}MSYS2 Min\+GW 64bit\textquotesingle{} from the Start menu and\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ git clone https://github.com/Theldus/wsServer.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd wsServer}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ mkdir build \&\& cd build/}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cmake .. -\/DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release -\/G "{}MinGW Makefiles"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ mingw32-\/make -\/j4}

\end{DoxyCode}
 And that\textquotesingle{}s it, the static library (libws.\+a) and the examples files are located in the build/examples folder.

The {\ttfamily echo} example can be run with\+: {\ttfamily ./examples/echo/echo.exe}, and the test webpage can be found at {\ttfamily ws\+Server/examples/echo}.
